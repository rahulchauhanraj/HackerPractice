/**
 *
 * You are in a party of N people, where only one person is known to everyone. Such a person may be present in the party, if yes, (s)he doesnâ€™t know anyone in the party. Your task is to find the stranger (celebrity) in party.
 You will be given a square matrix M where if an element of row i and column j  is set to 1 it means there is an edge from ith person to jth person. An edge represent the relation that i th person knows j th person. You need to complete the function getId which finds the id of the celebrity if present else return -1. The function getId takes two arguments the square matrix M and its size n.

 Input:
 The first line of input contains an element T denoting the No of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case consist of 2 lines. The first line of each test case contains a number denoting the size of the matrix M. Then in the next line are space separated values of the matrix M.

 Output:
 For each test case output will be the id of the celebrity if present (0 based index). Else -1 will be printed.

 Constraints:
 1<=T<=60
 1<=N<=40
 0<=M[][]<=1

 Example:
 Input (To be used only for expected output)
 1
 3
 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0

 Output
 1

 Explanation
 For the above test case the matrix will look like
 0 1 0
 0 0 0
 0 1 0
 Here  the celebrity is the person with index 1 ie id 1
